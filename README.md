# Inspiration
As avid baseball fans, our team realized a need for a more personalized coaching experience for everyone of all levels. We wanted to create a tool to help coaches and players, even normal people analyze their performance, identify areas for improvement, and provide targeted training plans to achieve their goals.

# What it does
HomeRunHero is an AI-powered coaching app that provides personalized feedback and training plans for baseball players. The app uses machine learning algorithms to analyze players' swing mechanics, pitch selection, and fielding techniques to provide real-time feedback and customized training plans. Coaches can use the app to track player progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust training plans accordingly.

# How we built it
To build HomeRunHero, we leveraged the latest advancements in machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics. We used Python and TensorFlow to train our machine learning models, and we integrated the app with cloud-based databases to store player data securely. We also have a UX design to design a prototype of this user interface.

# Challenges we ran into
When we are trying to brainstorm our initial ideas into actual products. Took us too long to think, due to non of us knowing about Baseball. That is the reason of conducting this app to make more people know about it.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We did The UI, UX, Machine Learning and Deck within 3 hours. After 2 hours of brainstorming our ideas in the morning.

# What we learned
Building HomeRunHero taught us a lot about the challenges and opportunities of using AI in sports coaching. We learned the importance of collecting high-quality data, designing user-friendly interfaces, and integrating feedback from coaches and players to improve the app's performance. The importance of collaboration

# What's next for HomeRunHero
We're constantly working to improve HomeRunHero and add new features to enhance the coaching experience. In the future, we plan to integrate the app with wearable technology to track players' movements and provide even more personalized feedback. We're also exploring opportunities to expand the app to other sports and activities, such as basketball, soccer, and dance. Our ultimate goal is to make HomeRunHero the go-to coaching app for athletes of all levels.
